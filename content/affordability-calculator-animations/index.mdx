### Animated Affordability Calculator

For my daily job at Trulia I had to recently build an affordability calculator to help home buyers find out how much they can afford.

To make the calculator more lively and fun to use, I had the opportunity to add some animations using the [GreenSock Animation Platform](https://greensock.com/). Working with the design team is among the most rewarding parts of my job, and I wrote a blog for the company's tech blog to document the collaboration and the technology behind the calculator:
