There are several studies on the benefits of language learning on the brain, from fighting aging, to boosting cognitive functions. The fact is, it remains really hard, especially with a full time job, and limited opportunities to travel.

To motivate myself to study I decided to sign up for the [HSK exam](http://www.chinesetest.cn/ChangeLan.do?languge=en) about a year ago, and that's how I started reviewing decks of flashcards. Answering to flashcard prompts correctly brought me great satisfaction, but I started asking myself... is there a way to make the process more fun?

# Gamified language learning
I started researching gamified apps, like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/), but in terms of retention, flashcard decks on [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) seemed to produce the best. In his book [Fluent Forever](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19661852-fluent-forever) Gabriel Wyner covers the history and theory of spaced repetition, and why I found it so effective.
That's when I started thinking about creating a game to learning Chinese based on spaced repetition

# Game requirements and Spaced Repetition
When I started writing down the requirements and ideas for a possible game, I stumbled upon the [Super Memo 2](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_1.0_for_DOS_(1987)#Algorithm_SM-2) algorithm to maximize the effectiveness of flashcard reviews. I modified the original algorithm to allow for continuous play, instead of only presenting the same flashcards after a given number of days, to avoid running out of cards.

# Pixel art and roguelikes
While Hanzi Dungeon is far from a complete study solution, I hope it still proves a fun way to review the HSK flashcards, and practice Chinese vocabulary.

I tried to combine my love for pixel art (thanks to the wonderful assets created by [Pita](https://pita.itch.io/)), and roguelike games, going for the SNES look and feel.
